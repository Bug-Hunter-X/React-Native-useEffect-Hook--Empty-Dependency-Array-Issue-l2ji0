This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an empty dependency array (`[]`).  It leads to unexpected behavior where the effect runs only once on mount but not on subsequent renders when props change or state updates that should trigger re-renders. This is counter intuitive compared to React's behavior in web applications.  The problem arises because React Native's reconciliation process may not always correctly identify that a re-render is needed after state or props changes when an empty dependency array is used within useEffect.
